# Simon Fl√∂ter...

... is a German artist based in Amsterdam.

His bold style is a result of unhealthy amounts of reading comics and watching the big bad boys do graffity.

His unmistakable style has not done much to establish him as one of the most sought after graphic artists or even any kind of artist. So far, Simon's clients mostly aren't big brands but the beerstore around the corner.
