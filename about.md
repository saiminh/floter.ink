# Simon Fl√∂ter

Simon is a German artist based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

His bold style is a result of consuming unhealthy amounts of indie comics, violent videogames, psychedelic music and scifi movies.

Strange fact: Simon can't [woot](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/woot). That's why so many of his images depict screaming figures.
